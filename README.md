# Contacts Manager
My submission for **Digital Product School** Software Engineering Challenge

This web app is deployed using Firebase. You can use the app here: https://contacts-manager-efef9.web.app or https://contacts-manager-efef9.firebaseapp.com/

**Tech Stack** used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, GitHub Actions, Firebase

* The [Landing Page](https://contacts-manager-efef9.web.app/) is the place where you can add new contacts in your Contact Manager, which would be updated in the Firebase Realtime Database. 
* The [Contacts Book](https://contacts-manager-efef9.web.app/table.html) page will list all the contacts present in you Contact Manager App.
* I have also implemented a Github Action Workflow for Continuous Deployment to Firebase Hosting.
* The web app has a simple, clean UI for easy use and access.
